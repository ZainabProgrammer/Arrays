function breakingRecords(scores) {
    let maxCount = scores[0];
    let minCount = scores[0];
    let countMax = 0; 
    let countMin = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < scores.length; i++) {
        if (scores[i] > maxCount) {
            countMax++;
            maxCount = scores[i];
        } else if (scores[i] < minCount) {
            countMin++;
            minCount = scores[i];
        }
    }

    return [countMax, countMin];
}

---------Sample Example--------

const scores = [10, 5, 20, 20, 4, 5, 2, 25, 1];

initially maxCount is 10 and minCount is also 10 stored in array;
moving to element 10 which is equal so loop return and move to element 5 which is less than maxCount mean it is min count so we incremented countMin to 1;
Next element is 20 which is greater than maxCount so it would increment countMax to 1 and so on. finally returning array of countMax and countMin respectively.
