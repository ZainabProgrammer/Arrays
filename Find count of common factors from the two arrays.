function getTotalX(a, b) {
    let count=0;
let maxFromA=Math.max(...a);
let minFromB=Math.min(...b);
for(let i=maxFromA; i<=minFromB; i++){
      if(b.every(ele=>ele%i===0)){
          if(a.every(ele=>i%ele===0)){
   count++
    }
    }
}
return count;
}
-----Sample example-------

const arr1 = [2, 4];
const arr2 = [16, 32, 96];
max from arr1 ===4
min from arr2 ===16
so we loop from 4 to 16 and start incrementing the value from 4 to 5 to 6 upto 16 and not greater than 16.
First we check through arry2 and then arr1 if current element is divisible by array2 and factor of arr1 then we increment the count and return it.
