function findSingle(arr){
    
    let res=arr[0];
    for(let i=1;i<arr.length; i++){
        res=res^arr[i];
    }

}

findSingle([2,2,3,4,5,5,4]);

Approach:
We take first element and xor it with all other elements in array because:
xor of element with itself gives 0
xor of element with 0 returns element itself.

So, xor of elements which occur more than once mean it will xor to give zero
and xor of element with 0 is element which means it occur once, which is our answer.
