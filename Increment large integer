QUESTION:
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer.
The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

SOLUTION:
-------------Arithmetic addition and carry propagation-----------

var plusOne = function(digits) {
 let ans = [];
    let carry = 1;

    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let total = digits[i] + carry;
        carry = Math.floor(total / 10);
        ans.unshift(total % 10);
    }

    if (carry) {
        ans.unshift(carry);
    }

    return ans;
};
