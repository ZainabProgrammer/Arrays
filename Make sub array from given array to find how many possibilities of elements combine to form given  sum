function birthday(s, d, m) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - m; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        
        for (let j = i; j < i + m; j++) {
            sum += s[j];
        }
        
        if (sum === d) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

------Sample Example------
s = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2];
d = 3;
m = 2;

here, size of s is 5 and we have to make 2 subsets
then elements in each subset would be 5-2=3;
it mean we have to iterate throuhg each 3 elements of subarray to find the sum.
Here, outer loop iterate through these 3 elements and inner loop finds sum if sum equals d then count is incremented by 1 and count finally is returned.
