-------Time complexity  O(n)--------

---------Sample Example----------

[1,2,2,1]
Iteration #1:
i=1 and i-1=0 1 is odd and conditions will be checked accordingly
Iteration #2:
i=2 which is even and prev element is greater than current no so no changes
Iteration #3:
i=3 which is odd and prev element is not greater so no change
Iteration #4:
i=4 which is even and prev element is greater so swapped
